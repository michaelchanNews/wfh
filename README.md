# Work From Home Slack slash command excuse generator
Simple and fun slash command to inform everyone in the channel that a person will work from home and come up with a random excuse.

If `/wfh` command is ran before 10:15am (team stand up) then it assumes that someone is working from home the same day. Otherwise, it's tomorrow.
